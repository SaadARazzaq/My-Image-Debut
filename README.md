# My Image Debut ðŸŒ™

Enhance the brightness of an image and correct its rotation for a clearer visual representation. This project focuses on gamma correction, a technique to adjust pixel intensity, and rotation to straighten the image.

## Overview ðŸ“·

### Gamma Correction ðŸŒˆ

Gamma correction involves raising the intensity values of pixels to a certain power (Î³). The formula is given by:

Iout
â€‹
 =Iin^Î³
â€‹

This project uses gamma correction with Î³ set to \( \frac{1}{2} \), making the resulting image brighter. Before correction, pixel values are rescaled to the range [0, 1].

### Image Rotation ðŸ”„

The original image of Boston at night may have a slight tilt. The goal is to straighten it by rotating it 1 degree while maintaining the image dimensions.

## Project Goal ðŸŽ¨

Create a grayscale version of the Boston night image with the following specifications:

1. **Brightness adjusted using gamma correction with Î³ = 1\2**
2. **Straightened by rotating 1 degree.**
3. **Image stored as uint8.**

## Instructions ðŸš€

1. **Ensure you have the necessary image file (e.g., "boston night.JPG").**
2. **Use the provided code to implement gamma correction and rotation.**
3. **Run the code to generate the adjusted image.**
4. **The final image should exhibit enhanced brightness and corrected rotation, achieving a result similar to the provided sample.**
